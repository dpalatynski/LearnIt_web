Learn it - A website application designed to learn vocabulary in English. Users get a word in Polish and they are asked to write a translation in English. This application is an improved version of a desktop flashcard application written previously using kivy library (see: https://github.com/dpalatynski/learnit). Flashcards check accuracy of the given answer and if it is wrong, they correct it.

Future updates:
- creating accounts,
- adding new words,
- creating personalized vocabulary lists.
